We live on a "microbial planet", yet a vast majority of microorganisms that exist in nature remain "uncultured", meaning no one has been able to grow let alone isolate the organism in the lab. Likewise, the functions of a vast majority of genes that microorganisms possess remain unknown. In other words, our understanding of microorganisms, their abilities, and the ecosystems these support is still very much preliminary. Our focus here is characterization of uncultured microorganisms through cultivation and environmental genomics ("metagenomics") for discovery of novel microbial functions that drive overlooked ecological processes. For example, we've isolated the first oxygen-independent (anaerobic) dead cell-scavenging bacterium (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-023-01538-2'>Hirakata et al., ISME J 2023</a>, see left figure with the isolated strain [red arrow] and a dead cell it has degraded the contents of [blue arrow]).
