I have been fortunate to receive an interdisciplinary education in <b><b>biology</b></b>, <b><b>geology</b></b>, and <b><b>engineering</b></b> (B.A. 2011, <a href='www.carleton.edu'>Carleton College</a>, MN // M.Sc. 2013 & Ph.D. 2017, <a href='cee.illinois.edu'>U of Illinois</a>), studying both ancient and modern Earth. Why is life the way it is? How can our understanding of life deepen our comprehension and protection of our planet? These questions lie at the heart of my passion for research.
