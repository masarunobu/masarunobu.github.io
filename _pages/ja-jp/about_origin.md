Life is theorized to have originated on the seafloor, in hydrothermal vents where hot alkaline hydrogen gas-rich fluids flow out. The vent fluids harbor a wide array of inorganic and organic compounds useful for life, which derives from a geochemical process known as "serpentinization". Meanwhile, the vents also host a wide variety of minerals that can catalyze non-biological ("abiotic") reactions remarkably similar to known those taking place in cells today. These together, in the absence of life, can theoretically form a chain of reactions very much like metabolism and this is theorized to have been the template for life (e.g., <a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-020-1125-6'>Preiner, Igarashi, and Muchowska et al., Nat Eco Evo 2020</a>). What hydrothermal vent reactions and "metabolism" did life mimic in the beginning? How did these facilitate evolution from metabolism to LUCA to, later, Bacteria and Archaea? We are in search of overlooked microbial metabolisms related to primordial metabolism and any "living fossil" organisms that preserve traces of primordial metabolisms (e.g., <a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-022-01197-9'>Nobu et al ISME J 2023</a>).
