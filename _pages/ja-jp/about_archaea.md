<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Archaea preserve one of the most ancient metabolisms, methanogenesis (more than 3.46 billion years old!), capable of  supporting life with just simple inorganic compounds – hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide. Histories recorded in genes have indicated that the origin of methanogenesis marked the origin of Archaea and that their evolution has been intertwined ever since (e.g., <a href='https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad023'>Mei et al., PNAS Nexus 2023</a>). Our next target: what were other metabolism(s) and milestones in the evolution and diversification of Archaea?</p>
Understanding who Archaea are and how they came to be is actually also essential for unraveling who "we" are. Us "Eukaryotes" – organisms with complex cells spanning nearly all life visible to the naked eye and more – are theorized to have originated from a lineage of archaea ("Asgard archaea") and we have isolated the first member of this lineage (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1916-6'>Imachi et al., Nature 2020</a>, see right). We are currently exploring how these archaea live and what allowed their ancestor to make the evolutionary jump from simple to complex life.
