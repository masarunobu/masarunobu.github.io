Photosynthesis changed the course of life and Earth history. Life harnessing light  allowed reactions that weren't possible before and boosted production of organic matter, enriching our planet with compounds life can easily exploit for energy (e.g., sugars and oxygen). However, how photosynthesis originated, how photosynthesis developed over time from its primordial to modern forms, and how these relate to the evolution of life itself had remained enigmatic. Without uncovering this, we can neither understand Earth's history nor truly comprehend the role/contribution of photosynthetic organisms (e.g., cyanobacteria, algae, land plants) in Earth's ecosystems today. We study photosynthetic organisms' uncharted history recorded in genes using phylogenetic tools (e.g., <a href='https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2322120121'>Nishihara et al., PNAS 2024</a>) and overlooked physiology via careful inspection of isolate metabolic behavior using omics tools.
