In the world of animals and plants, form and function go hand-in-hand. A giraffe's long neck, a kangaroo's pouch, and a whale's balleen (filter/bristles) are some examples. On the other hand, the relationship between form and function remains unclear for microorganisms, especially those with simple cells (Bacteria and Archaea). With rapid advances in microscopy, we are able to visualize microorganisms at resolutions unimaginable even a decade ago. One major focus in our group is revisiting the cell structure of Bacteria and Archaea to discover new functions in these microorganisms and show that ties between form and function also applies to tiny organisms. Some examples are findings of a bacterium that has an extra membrane protecting its chromosome (almost like eukaryotes!?) (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20149-5'>Katayama et al., Nat Comm 2020</a>), an "indecisive" bacterium that threw away its ability to control its cell shape and make its own cell wall to save a little energy <a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-024-01717-7'>Katayama et al., Nat Microb 2024</a>), and an archaeon that produces long, branching protrusions from its tiny cell for unknown reasons (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1916-6'>Imachi et al., Nature 2020</a>).
